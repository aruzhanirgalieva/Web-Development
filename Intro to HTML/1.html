<h1>Poem about Little Red Riding Hood And The Wolf</h1>
<h2>Songs</h2>
<p>As soon as Wolf began to feel<br>
    That he would like a decent meal,<br>
    He went and knocked on Grandma's door.<br>
    When Grandma opened it, she saw<br>
    The sharp white teeth, the horrid grin,<br>
    And Wolfie said, 'May I come in?'<br>
    Poor Grandmamma was terrified,<br>
    'He's going to eat me up!' she cried.<br>
    And she was absolutely right.</p>
